# three-js-handle-maker

# Notes from Adam Fieldson:

This is where I did all of my experimentation with ThreeJS and JSCanvas.  

If you want to follow the code, I would start at canvasrenderer.js.  Here 
is where the canvas to be wrapped around the handle is made.  There is a 
seperate function for every handle design.  If you would like to see this canvas, 
take away the "hidded" class from the "materialCanvas" element in index.html.

After looking at that, you can head to client.js, where ThreeJS is used to 
render the handle in the "myCanvas" element of index.html.
